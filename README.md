# MongoDB CRUD Project - Student Management System

Welcome to the MongoDB CRUD project for managing student records in a university setting! This project provides a comprehensive solution for performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on student data stored in a MongoDB database. With this system, you can efficiently manage student information such as name, class, roll number, subjects, and email address.

## Features

- **Schema Definition**: Define a Mongoose schema to structure the student data, ensuring consistency and integrity.
- **Database Connectivity**: Establish a connection to MongoDB to facilitate seamless data operations.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - **Create**: Add new student records to the database.
  - **Read**: Retrieve student records from the database.
  - **Update**: Modify existing student records, such as adding new subjects.
  - **Delete**: Remove unnecessary student records while preserving data integrity.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Utilize async/await to execute database operations asynchronously, enhancing performance and responsiveness.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage exceptions and ensure uninterrupted operation.
- **Modular Structure**: Organize code into modular components for improved maintainability and scalability.
- **Version Control**: Track changes using version control to facilitate collaboration and code management.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mongodb-crud-project.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies using npm:
